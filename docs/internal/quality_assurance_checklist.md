- **High**: Major feature broken, affects user experience significantly
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issue, workaround available
- **Low**: Cosmetic issue, minor inconvenience

### Escalation Matrix

| Severity | Response Time        | Escalation Level  | Communication          |
| -------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Critical | Immediate (< 1 hour) | Senior Management | All stakeholders       |
| High     | Within 4 hours       | Technical Lead    | Project Manager + Team |
| Medium   | Within 24 hours      | Team Lead         | Development Team       |
| Low      | Within 1 week        | Individual        | Development Team       |

### Escalation Process

1. **Initial Assessment**: Assess severity and impact
2. **Immediate Actions**: Implement temporary workarounds if possible
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate underlying causes
4. **Solution Development**: Develop and implement permanent solution
5. **Prevention Measures**: Implement measures to prevent recurrence
6. **Documentation**: Document issue, resolution, and prevention measures
