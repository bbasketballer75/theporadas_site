chore(scope): concise imperative summary <= 100 chars

# Body (wrap at 100):
# - Detail what and why, not how.
# - Reference issue IDs (e.g. Closes #123).

# Footer examples:
# BREAKING CHANGE: description
# Closes: #123

# Tips:
# - Keep header scope small (env, ci, deps, docs, media).
# - Omit trailing period in subject.
# - Prefer present tense: add, fix, remove.
