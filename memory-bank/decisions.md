# Architectural Decisions

## MCP Server Ecosystem Setup

### Decision: Comprehensive MCP Server Configuration

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Context:** Need for full MCP server coverage across all available services  
**Decision:** Configure all 25 MCP servers in servers.json with proper naming, commands, arguments, and restart policies  
**Rationale:** Ensures complete functionality and prevents missing server issues  
**Consequences:**

- Increased configuration complexity
- Better service coverage and reliability
- Easier maintenance through centralized configuration

### Decision: Docker Compose Orchestration

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Context:** Need for containerized MCP server deployment with health checks and dependencies  
**Decision:** Expand docker-compose.yml with all MCP services, health checks, environment variables, and proper service dependencies  
**Rationale:** Provides robust container orchestration and simplifies deployment  
**Consequences:**

- Improved scalability and isolation
- Better resource management
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities

### Decision: Environment Variable Validation

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Context:** Need for robust pre-deployment validation of MCP server configurations  
**Decision:** Enhance preflight.mjs with comprehensive environment variable checks for all MCP servers  
**Rationale:** Prevents runtime failures due to missing or invalid configuration  
**Consequences:**

- Earlier error detection
- Better developer experience
- Reduced deployment issues

### Decision: Supervisor-Based Server Management

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Context:** Need for centralized MCP server lifecycle management  
**Decision:** Use supervisor pattern in mcp_supervisor.mjs with configuration file support  
**Rationale:** Provides reliable server spawning, monitoring, and restart capabilities  
**Consequences:**

- Improved server reliability
- Centralized management
- Better error handling and logging

### Decision: VS Code Development Optimization

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Context:** Need for enhanced development experience with proper tooling integration  
**Decision:** Enhance .vscode/settings.json with LF enforcement, ESLint/Prettier integration, Copilot optimizations, and test conveniences  
**Rationale:** Improves code quality, consistency, and developer productivity  
**Consequences:**

- Consistent code formatting
- Better linting and error detection
- Enhanced AI assistance
- Improved testing workflow

## Technology Choices

### Runtime Environment

- **Node.js with ES Modules:** Chosen for MCP server runtime due to widespread adoption and excellent async support
- **Docker Containers:** Selected for isolation, portability, and easy deployment
- **PowerShell Scripts:** Used for Windows compatibility and automation tasks

### Configuration Management

- **JSON Configuration Files:** Simple, human-readable format for server definitions
- **Environment Variables:** Flexible configuration without code changes
- **YAML for Docker Compose:** Standard for container orchestration

### Development Tools

- **ESLint + Prettier:** Code quality and formatting consistency
- **Vitest:** Fast, modern testing framework
- **GitHub Copilot:** AI-assisted development
- **VS Code Extensions:** Integrated development environment optimizations

## Future Considerations

### Scalability

- Monitor resource usage as MCP server count increases
- Consider load balancing for high-traffic services
- Evaluate serverless deployment options

### Security

- Implement proper secret management for API keys
- Add authentication and authorization layers
- Regular security audits of MCP servers

### Monitoring

- Add comprehensive logging and metrics
- Implement health check endpoints
- Create dashboards for system monitoring
