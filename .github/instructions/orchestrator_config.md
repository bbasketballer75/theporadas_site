# Orchestrator Mode Configuration

## Task Management System

- [ ] **Task Planning Phase**: Analyze requirements, break down into subtasks, identify dependencies
- [ ] **Execution Phase**: Implement subtasks sequentially with validation at each step
- [ ] **Validation Phase**: Test, lint, and verify all changes work correctly
- [ ] **Documentation Phase**: Update documentation and create usage examples

## Subtask Categories

- **Research**: API documentation, library compatibility, best practices
- **Implementation**: Code changes, file creation, dependency management
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, manual validation
- **Optimization**: Performance improvements, code cleanup, error handling

## Validation Checkpoints

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Linting passes with zero errors
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility standards maintained

## Communication Guidelines

- Always show progress with detailed todo lists
- Use emoji indicators: ‚úÖ (completed), üîÑ (in progress), ‚è≥ (pending), ‚ùå (failed)
- Provide clear status updates before each major action
- Include validation results for each completed subtask
