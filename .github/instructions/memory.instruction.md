# Memory Instructions

User prefers VS Code Insiders builds. Enable and prefer experimental Copilot features (chat modes, prompt and instruction files) when available; provide Insiders-specific guidance and links where relevant.

Canonical project blueprint: Always consult and keep in sync with `.github/project_instructions.md`. Treat it as the source of truth for goals, scope, architecture, and acceptance criteria. When conflicts arise, defer to this file and propose updates back into it.
