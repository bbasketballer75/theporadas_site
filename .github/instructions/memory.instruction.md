# Memory Instructions

User prefers VS Code Insiders builds. Enable and prefer experimental
Copilot features (chat modes, prompt and instruction files) when
available; provide Insiders-specific guidance and links where
relevant.

Canonical project blueprint: Always consult and keep in sync with
`.github/project_instructions.md`. Treat it as the source of truth for
goals, scope, architecture, and acceptance criteria. When conflicts
arise, defer to this file and propose updates back into it.

Monogram: User removed placeholder monogram variants (not satisfied
with generated styles) and will later provide a custom single SVG
asset. Until then, no monogram should appear in the hero; keep hero
minimal. Avoid re-introducing monogram assets unless provided
explicitly by user.
