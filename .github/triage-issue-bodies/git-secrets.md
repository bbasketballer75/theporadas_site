Triage for file: git-secrets

Evidence: Numerous historical entries reference 'git-secrets' configuration lines that include the example token REDACTED_BY_AUDIT_ISSUE_70. These appear to be example entries added by git-secrets or related tooling.

Suggested action:
- Confirm these are example/test entries (likely false positives).
- If benign, add label security/false-positive and close the per-file issue.
- Otherwise, rotate any real tokens and update the master rotation issue #43.
