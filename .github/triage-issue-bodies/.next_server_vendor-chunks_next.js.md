Triage for file: .next/server/vendor-chunks/next.js

Evidence extracted from security-scans/AWS_AK.txt and other scan outputs:

- Multiple historical entries reference git-secrets allowed examples found at lines indicating 'add_config 'secrets.allowed' 'REDACTED_BY_AUDIT_ISSUE_70'' (likely false-positive: example token).

Suggested action:
- Review the file to confirm whether any real credentials are present.
- If confirmed benign (examples), mark as false-positive and close the per-file triage.
- If any real secrets are found, rotate them immediately and coordinate with the master rotation issue #43.
