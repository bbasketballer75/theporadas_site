Triage for file: .next/static/chunks/main.js

Evidence extracted from security-scans/AWS_AK.txt and other scan outputs:

- References to 'add_config secrets.allowed' in historical commits; likely git-secrets examples or build artifact noise.

Suggested action:

- Validate and, if benign, mark as false-positive.
- If secrets are found, rotate immediately and link evidence to master rotation issue #43.

## Remediation checklist & rotation evidence

- [ ] Confirm whether this is build noise (.next artifacts) or real secrets.
- [ ] If build artifacts leak secrets, adjust .gitignore and build steps; purge any tracked build artifacts from history (done).
- [ ] If secrets found, rotate and update environment injection mechanisms to avoid including secrets in built artifacts.

Rotation evidence:

- Rotated at (UTC):
- Build processes updated:
- Notes:
