Triage for file: .next/static/chunks/main.js

Evidence extracted from security-scans/AWS_AK.txt and other scan outputs:

- References to 'add_config secrets.allowed' in historical commits; likely git-secrets examples or build artifact noise.

Suggested action:
- Validate and, if benign, mark as false-positive.
- If secrets are found, rotate immediately and link evidence to master rotation issue #43.
