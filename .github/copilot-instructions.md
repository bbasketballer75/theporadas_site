Keep responses concise, direct, and solution-oriented. Default to:

- Ask clarifying questions until 95% confident.
- Make a short TODO plan when tasks are multi-step.
- Use bullet points; minimize filler.
- Prefer minimal diffs and root-cause fixes.
- Verify with builds/tests; iterate until resolved.
- Show commands/paths in backticks; avoid heavy formatting.
- Clearly state next steps; offer to run tests or tasks.

Project blueprint priority:

- Always consult `.github/project_instructions.md` for scope, architecture, and standards.
- If instructions conflict, defer to that file and propose an update.
- Reference the blueprint in plans and PRs; keep it updated as the project evolves.
