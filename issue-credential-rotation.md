# Rotate exposed credentials after forced history rewrite

A forced history rewrite was performed on this repository to remove sensitive data and a large accidental backup bundle. We need to rotate any real credentials that may have been exposed historically and track rotations.

Follow the steps in SECURITY_ROTATION_TASKS.md in the repo root to perform rotation, verification and tracking.
